  <p><b>Synopsis:</b> <br>Creating the safest and convenient Payment App in South Africa. My initial aim was to make the experience easy and engaging. I worked with the founders and sucessfully launched the app. We discussed and found the points
    that would make payment a better process. Understanding the south african market, we decided on chat bot for signup and scanning bar code for easy payment with the tied merchants as a better approach.</p>
  <div class="">
    <p><b>Target customers:</b><br> The target customers were south african users with internet and smart phone.</p>

    <p><b>Information architecture:</b></p>

  <p> Based on the given brief, coming up with information architecture for each use case. We wanted the app to be engaging and to do so, we went with chat bot approach for the entire app experience. </p>
  <p>My main aim was to think about how to guide the customer to have a flowless and engaging experience, I looked at other compitators and was trying to address the problem of process of signup being a tiresome and long process into a more engaging
    and flawless.</p>
